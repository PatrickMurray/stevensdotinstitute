stevens.institute is an imageboard designed for the Stevens community. It's a
place for open, anonymous collaboration and discussion. Within the various
boards you'll find topic ranging from campus life and events to media and
technology news. The epemeral nature of the platform means that topics stick
around only as long as they're relevant: once a thread is pruned for
inactivaty, it's gone for good. Best of all, there's no accounts to manage, you
can just jump right in and post.

Please take a look at our Rules page for information about what is and is not
acceptible on the platform.

stevens.institute is not affiliated with or endorsed by Stevens Institute of
Technology. The meassages posted within do not necessarily reflect the views of
